Barker is a Twitter inspired app where users can write, share, comment and like posts (called barks).
Users can follow each other in order to see their barks.
Each user has a profile page with information about their followers, who they are following and their activity on Barker (barks, comments and likes).


This app is based on React with use of React Router (Redirect, Links, NavLinks).
The database is based on Firebase.

This project was very challenging and helped me solidify my knowledge of React.
I also deepened my React Router know-how and refreshed my skills with async code.
The hardest challenge was probably learning how to properly use Firebase. Luckily Firebase has a very explanatory documentation that helped me tackle the learning curve.
